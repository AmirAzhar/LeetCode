// at every house you have a choice to rob a house or not
// What gives us more money â€” skipping this house and keeping what we had, or robbing this house and adding its value to the best we could get two houses ago
// so we need to track the max value at the prev house, and prev prev house
// at any house we can either

    // rob and add on to what we had in the prev prev house - prev2 + num
// return prev1 because that is the max value at the last ele
